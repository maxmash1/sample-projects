# Project 3: Using GitHub Copilot to convert the Tic Tac Toe game and run it in the browser

In this workshop, we will focus on using the power of GitHub Copilot to convert an existing project. Use GitHub Copilot to create a browser version of the Tic Tac Toe game.

As a developer, your goal is to **use prompts to create the necessary files**. Feel free to accomplish this in any order you like

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

GitHub Copilot acts as your AI pair programmer, offering suggestions based on context and code patterns. In this workshop, you'll use GitHub Copilot to create a browser version of the Tic Tac Toe game you completed in the first exercise. No order or task list is provided, the goal here is to prompt Copilot Chat to create the Javascript version of this game and any other necessary files you need to run it in the browser (hint: HTML, CSS). Optionally if you have time you can modify the look of the webpage to make the game interface visually appealing.
