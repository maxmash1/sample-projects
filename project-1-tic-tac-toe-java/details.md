# Project 2: Using GitHub Copilot To modify/fix an existing Tic Tac Toe game

In this workshop, we will focus on using the power of GitHub Copilot to fix issues with an existing project. There is a working Tic Tac Toe game written in Java but it has problems.

As a developer, your goal is to **find and fix the problems**. We recommend the following tasks in order:
- Compile and run the java program from the command line/terminal. (if you don't know how to do this, ask GH Copilot chat)
- Were you able to ask Copilot (using chat) if there were any issues with the provided code?
- Use GitHub Copilot to fix the issues, re-run and make the game work properly.
- Generate unit tests to verify the game is working as expected.
- Are you able to refactor and/or optimize the code, any methods?
- Generate documentation based on the code that explains what the program does.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

GitHub Copilot acts as your AI pair programmer, offering suggestions based on context and code patterns. In this workshop, you'll use GitHub Copilot to fix, test, and document code through suggestions and prompts. As you work through the exercise, you'll learn how to use GitHub Copilot to fix existing code at a rapid pace and increase your productivity. While working, document or keep in mind the suggestions that GitHub Copilot provides to help you understand the code better.
